those who wants to know more about NP's facilities. Users would go on a "scavenger hunt" around the campus to collect items and at the same time 
explore wherever the website brings them to. This website would also gives information on the location users are at to help them learn about the place more. Lastly, users get to gain points throughout this "scavenger hunt" and this points will help them win prizes.
